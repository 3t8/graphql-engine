# Versioning

> For now, Please refer Docusaurus [Versioning Docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning).
Will write a detailed writeup of how we should manage config and steps to version our docs soon.

This should probably go into the wiki-guide post migration detailing how to version docs.
Will populate this section post migration which is when we will have more data points to consider.
