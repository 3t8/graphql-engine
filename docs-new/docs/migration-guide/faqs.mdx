# FAQs

<details>
<summary>How to start the migration process?</summary>

Convert file from `.rst` to `.mdx`. 
We used an auto transform tool [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to automate this and added the resultant content in `.txt` file.

1. Convert the transsformed `.rst.txt` to `.mdx` extension for the file to be able to show up in sidebar and UI.
2. Use this guide for syntactical and usage reference.
3. Validate content and cleanup misc divs that are populated during auto transform and any invalid mdx data.
4. The misc populated divs exist to ease adding metadata and any sphinx directives that can't be auto transformed to mdx. Please cross referene the actual RST file for content validation.


Verify content correctness and preview in UI.

<summary>How to control sidebar label & items order?</summary>

**For Individual Files**
Make use of `sidebar_label` and `sidebar_position` meta

```markdown
---
sidebar_label: Hasura Core
sidebar_position: 3
---
```

**For Directories (Categories)**
Please add a `__category__.json` and add the `label` and `position` properties.

```json
{
  "label": "Hasura Core",
  "position": 1
}
```

Please read the docusaurus docs about this here - https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#autogenerated-sidebar-metadata

<summary>index file routes are resolved to `directory/` and not `directory/index`</summary>

Use `slug` metadata to manually set the slug to `directory/index`. Please check [this PR on docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/5830) for more information.

```markdown title="index.mdx"
---
...
slug: /migration-guide/index
---
```

<details>
<summary>A directory is not visible in sidebar when only index.mdx file exists</summary>

This is known and default behaviour from docusaurus. `index` is considered direct link to directory index and won't be visible unless there is one more file.

To fix, rename the file from `index.mdx` to `directory-name.mdx` and remove the directory.

<summary>How to link (internal) other documents that are not migrated yet?</summary>

Currently, broken MDX links are set to warn to ease the migration process. So, add the file path as link.

To get the file path, do a global search for id in `graphql-engine/docs/graphql/` directory and use the respective file path.

![Link File Path From Ref Screencapture](/img/migration-guide/link-file-path-from-ref.png)

:::tip
You can prepend the id with `.. _` to only get the file id as result and not include the usage files.
:::

The root relative link should start at `graphql` directory level.

Ex: Link from above screnshot `/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/actions.mdx`

```markdown
[actions Metadata API](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/actions.mdx)
```
Please refer [Links](/migration-guide/links.mdx) for more information about links usage.
