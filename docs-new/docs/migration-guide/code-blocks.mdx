# Code Blocks

These are straightforward syntax swap as given below.

## Sphinx - RST

```rest {1-2}
.. code-block:: graphql
   :emphasize-lines: 2,5

    query {
      authors (where: {articles: {rating: {_gt: 4}}}) {
        id
        name
        articles (where: {rating: {_gt: 4}}) {
          id
          title
          rating
        }
      }
    }
```

## Docusaurus - MDX

```markdown
    // highlight-next-line
    ```graphql {2,5}
        query {
          authors (where: {articles: {rating: {_gt: 4}}}) {
            id
            name
            articles (where: {rating: {_gt: 4}}) {
              id
              title
              rating
            }
          }
        }
    // highlight-next-line
    ```
```

## Result in UI

```graphql {2,5}
  query {
    authors (where: {articles: {rating: {_gt: 4}}}) {
      id
      name
      articles (where: {rating: {_gt: 4}}) {
        id
        title
        rating
      }
    }
  }
```

:::caution Supported Languages

- Docusaurus uses prisma under the hood for code-block syntax highlighting. Please refer to the supported languages [here](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages).
- By default prisma includes a few that are listed [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/vendor/prism/includeLangs.js). If any supported language is not listed here, please added it to `additionalLanguages` under prisma plugin in `docusaurus.config.js`
