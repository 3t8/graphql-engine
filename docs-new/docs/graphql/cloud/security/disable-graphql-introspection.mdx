# Disable GraphQL introspection

<CustomTOCListHead>Table of contents</CustomTOCListHead>
<TOCInline toc={toc} />

## Introduction

The graphql-engine by default enables [GraphQL Schema Introspection](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Schema-Introspection) which gives full information about the schema and may not be desired in production.

To avoid this, you can disable GraphQL introspection on a per-role basis.

## Disabling GraphQL introspection for a role

Introspection can be disabled for a role as shown below:
