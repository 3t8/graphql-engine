## Introduction

The graphql-engine by default enables [GraphQL Schema
Introspection](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Schema-Introspection)
which gives full information about the schema and may not be desired in
production.

To avoid this, you can disable GraphQL introspection on a per-role
basis.

## Disabling GraphQL introspection for a role

Introspection can be disabled for a role as shown below:
