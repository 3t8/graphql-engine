## Introduction

You can specify a list of safe operations (GraphQL queries, mutations or
subscriptions) for your project. This list restricts your project's
GraphQL Engine to execute only queries that are present in the list.

## Manage the allow list

The manager view offers inspection, export, or removal of operations in
the allow list:

## Quick-create allowed operations

This Pro feature lets you add to the allow list with one click from the
record of past operations. (With Core, allow lists must be
`managed manually <allow_list>`.)
