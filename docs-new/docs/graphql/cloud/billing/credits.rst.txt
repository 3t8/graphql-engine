## Introduction

If you have a coupon, you can redeem it from the dashboard to get a
credit waiver on your next invoice. Discounts will be adjusted while
creating the invoice.

## Redeem a coupon

Navigate to the `Billing` tab, click on `Coupons and Credits`, enter the
code and click on the redeem button. Only one coupon is applied.

If there is an active coupon and another coupon is applied, then the
later coupon is used.
