have been invited to the project.

### Collaborator roles

Collaborators can have different levels of access in the Hasura console.

-   **Admin** has complete access to the console i.e they can change the
    schema and the GraphQL engine metadata.
-   **User** has limited privileges:
    -   The `Execute GraphQL` permission allows running queries,
        mutations and subscriptions from the `GraphiQL` tab of the
        console.
    -   The `View Metrics` permission allows inspecting operation data
        and metrics from the `PRO` tab of the console.
