## Introduction

This page introduces Postgres including benefits and caveats, and it
links to sections relevant to extending your GraphQL API by using
Postgres features.

## About Postgres

[Postgres (or PostgreSQL)](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a
general-purpose object-relational database management system that uses
and extends the SQL language. Postgres is free and open source and has
been developed continuously over the last 30 years. Postgres strives to
be reliable, robust and performant.

Postgres supports advanced data types and advanced performance
optimization, features that are otherwise only available in expensive
commercial database systems.

## Benefits of Postgres

The following are benefits of Postgres compared to other database
management systems:

-   Postgres can be maintained easily because of its stability. The
    total cost of ownership is therefore low.
-   Postgres is designed to be extensible i.e. you can add custom
    functions using different programming languages.
-   You can define your own data types, index types etc.
-   If you need any support, an [active
    community](https://www.postgresql.org/community/) is available to
    help.

## Postgres features

The following are some Postgres features that can be used to manage your
data and extend your Hasura GraphQL API:

-   `Constraints <postgres_constraints>`
-   `Views <postgres_views>`
-   `Functions <postgres_functions>`
-   `Triggers <postgres_triggers>`
-   `Indexes <postgres_indexes>`
-   `Import data from CSV <postgres_import_data_from_csv>`
