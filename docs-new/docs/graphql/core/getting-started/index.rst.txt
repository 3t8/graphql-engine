## Introduction

To use the Hasura GraphQL engine, you need to:

-   Deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine, with access to a Postgres database
    to store its metadata.
-   Connect new/existing database(s) and set up and test your GraphQL
    API using the Hasura console UI *(also possible via CLI or API)*.
-   Consume the generated GraphQL API from your client apps.

## Quickstart guides

-   `Using Hasura Cloud <cloud_getting_started>` - Create a new Hasura
    Cloud project with just a few clicks.
    -   Recommended as it's **the fastest way** to try Hasura GraphQL
        engine out.
    -   Comes with **extra features for reliability and security** and a
        managed metadata database.

Hasura is open-source and can also be downloaded locally.
`Set up Hasura GraphQL engine using Docker Compose <docker_simple>`.
This is recommended if you want to **run Hasura locally** or if your
database cannot be exposed to Hasura Cloud.

## Supported databases

Hasura GraphQL engine supports:

-   `Postgres <database_postgres>`
-   `MS SQL Server <database_ms_sql_server>`
-   `Citus / Hyperscale <database_citus-hyperscale-postgres>`
-   `BigQuery <database_bigquery>`
-   **MySQL** (in preview) - See the `preview guide <mysql_preview>`
