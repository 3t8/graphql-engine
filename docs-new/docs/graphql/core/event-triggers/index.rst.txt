## Introduction

Hasura can be used to create event triggers on tables in the Postgres
database. Event triggers reliably capture events on specified tables and
invoke webhooks to carry out any custom logic.

Events can be of the following types:

-   INSERT: When a row is inserted into a table
-   UPDATE: When a row is updated in a table
-   DELETE: When a row is deleted from a table
-   MANUAL: Using the console or API, an event can be triggered manually
    on a row

Event webhook notifications will be delivered at least once, and may
arrive out of order with respect to the underlying event.
