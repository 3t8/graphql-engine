## Overview

Authentication is handled outside of Hasura. Hasura delegates
authentication and resolution of request headers into session variables
to your authentication service *(existing or new)*.

Your authentication service is required to pass a user's **role**
information in the form of session variables like `X-Hasura-Role`, etc.
More often than not, you'll also need to pass user information for your
access control use cases, like `X-Hasura-User-Id`, to build permission
rules.

You can also configure Hasura to allow access to unauthenticated users
by configuring a specific role which will be set for all unauthenticated
requests.

## Authentication options

Hasura supports two modes of authentication configuration:

### 1. Webhook

Your auth server exposes a webhook that is used to authenticate all
incoming requests to the Hasura GraphQL engine server and to get
metadata about the request to evaluate access control rules.

Here's how a GraphQL request is processed in webhook mode:

### 2. JWT (JSON Web Token)

Your auth server issues JWTs to your client app, which, when sent as
part of the request, are verified and decoded by the GraphQL engine to
get metadata about the request to evaluate access control rules.

Here's how a GraphQL query is processed in JWT mode:
