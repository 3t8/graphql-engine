## Introduction

The Health API is a public endpoint which gives info on the server
health.

## Endpoint

All requests are `GET` requests to the `/healthz` endpoint. There's also
`/hasura/healthz` available as an alternative, which mirrors `/healthz`
completely.

## API Spec

### Request

``` http
GET /healthz HTTP/1.1
```

### Response

Depending on the server health status any of the following responses can
be returned:

| Server condition                                                          | HTTP Status | Message                              |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| All healthy                                                               | 200         | OK                                   |
| Serving requests but some metadata objects are inconsistent/not-available | 200         | WARN: inconsistent objects in schema |
| Unhealthy                                                                 | 500         | ERROR                                |

If there are metadata inconsistencies, you should use the Hasura console
or the `get_inconsistent_metadata <get_inconsistent_metadata>` API to
find out what the inconsistent objects are and resolve them.
