If there are any issues with the migrations that are applied, you can
roll back the database and Hasura metadata to a desired version using
the `down` migrations.

Rollbacks will only work if there are `down` migrations defined. The
console will not generate `down` migrations for SQL statements executed
from the `SQL` tab, even though you can add them as an `up` migration.

Rollback also means applying down migrations. Here are some example
scenarios:

To roll back all the applied migrations, execute:

```bash
hasura migrate apply --down all
```

To roll back the last 2 migration versions:

```bash
hasura migrate apply --down 2
```

To roll back a particular migration version:

```bash
hasura migrate apply --version 1550925483858 --type down
```
