## Migration filename format

Each migration file has the following format:

```bash
<version>_<name>.{up|down}.sql
```

A `version` which is the Unix timestamp in nanoseconds when the file was
created is the first part. Followed by a `name` which is either manually
added or auto-generated by the console. The next part indicates what
step this is. If it is `up`, it means that this is the forward step,
e.g. creating a table. The `down` indicates that it is the corresponding
rollback step.

## Migration file format

A migration SQL file can contain SQL statements which are executed on
the apply step of the migration. There can be an `up` migration and a
`down` migration file.
