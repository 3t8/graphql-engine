# Getting started with MS SQL Server

To try Hasura with SQL Server, you'll need your own new or existing SQL
Server database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura:

1.  `Hasura Cloud <database_ms_sql_server_cloud>`: You'll need to be
    able to access your SQL Server database from Hasura Cloud.
2.  `Docker <database_ms_sql_server_docker>`: Run Hasura with Docker and
    then connect your SQL Server database to Hasura.
