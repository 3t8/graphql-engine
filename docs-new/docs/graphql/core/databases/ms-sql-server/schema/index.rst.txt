The Hasura GraphQL engine automatically generates your GraphQL schema
and resolvers based on your tables/views in MS SQL Server. **You don't
need to write a GraphQL schema or resolvers.** See
`How Hasura GraphQL engine works <how_it_works>` for more details.

The Hasura console gives you UI tools that speed up your data-modelling
process, or working with your existing database. The console also
automatically generates migrations or metadata files that you can edit
directly and check into your version control.

The Hasura GraphQL engine lets you do anything you would usually do with
MS SQL Server by giving you GraphQL over native MS SQL Server
constructs.
