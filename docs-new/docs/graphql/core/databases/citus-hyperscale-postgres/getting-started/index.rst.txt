# Getting started with Citus - Hyperscale

To try Hasura with Citus, you'll need your own new or existing Citus
database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura:

1.  `Hasura Cloud <database_citus_hyperscale_cloud>`: You'll need to be
    able to access your Citus database from Hasura Cloud.
2.  `Docker <database_citus_hyperscale_docker>`: Run Hasura with Docker
    and then connect your Citus database to Hasura.
