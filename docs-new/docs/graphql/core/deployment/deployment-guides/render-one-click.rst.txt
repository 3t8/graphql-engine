Once you're logged into your Render account, click the button below to
deploy Hasura and a new managed PostgreSQL database wired up to your
Hasura instance.

That's it! Read on to configure your Hasura instance.

## Access your Hasura Console

Once **Deploy to Render** succeeds, you can click through to your Hasura
service page on Render's dashboard.

You can monitor the deployment of the Hasura web service from the
**Logs** tab. Once the service is up, use the link on the service page
to access your Hasura console:

``` bash
https://<your-hasura-slug>.onrender.com/
```

You can create tables and test your GraphQL queries here.
