Make sure to [create an Nhost account](https://nhost.io/register) first.
Nhost offers a 30-day trial with its starter plan.

Once you're logged into your Nhost account, click the `create project`
button below to configure your project.

The creation and provisioning of your backend should be ready in roughly
30 seconds. Your project has now a GraphQL API, a PostgreSQL database,
user management, and storage for your files!

## Access your Hasura console

Once your Nhost project is up and running, the `Overview` page will give
information about the endpoints.

Click on the `Hasura` tab in the navigation to open the dashboard. Then
click on the `Open Hasura Console` button to open the Hasura console.

To test it, you can either create tables directly using the console, or
add new users to your project clicking on `Auth` on the navigation menu.

There is also a `GraphQL API` option for you to test the API.
