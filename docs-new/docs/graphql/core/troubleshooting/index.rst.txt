### Server logs

For errors that come from the Hasura server, server logs will give you
more insights. For details on how you can access these logs, as well as
different log types, visit `this page <hge_logs>`.

### Console logs

Should there be any error coming from the Hasura console UI, they will
show up in the Browser dev tools.

### Remote service logs

Errors can come from a remote service, such as
`remote schemas <remote_schemas>`, `events <event_triggers>` or
`actions <actions>`. In this case, check the errors of the respective
remote service. For actions, check out this
`debugging page <debugging_actions>`.
