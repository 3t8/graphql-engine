## Introduction

Hasura stores action logs of `async actions <async_actions>` in a table
in the metadata schema. As the table gets larger, you may want to prune
it.

You can use any of the following options to prune your logs depending on
your need.

Warning

-   Deleting logs is irreversible, so be careful with these actions.
-   Deleting logs while subscriptions for the response might still be
    open may result into the loss of data and `null` values been
    returned.

## The table involved

There is a specific table for action logs that is managed by Hasura:

-   `hdb_catalog.hdb_action_log`: This table stores all captured action
    logs.

## Option 1: Delete log of a particular action invocation

```SQL
DELETE FROM hdb_catalog.hdb_action_log WHERE id = '<async-action-id>';
```

## Option 2: Delete all logs of a specific action

```SQL
DELETE FROM hdb_catalog.hdb_action_log WHERE action_name = '<action-name>';
```

## Option 3: Delete all logs older than a time period

```SQL
DELETE FROM hdb_catalog.hdb_action_log WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '3 months';
```

## Option 4: Delete all logs

```SQL
DELETE FROM hdb_catalog.hdb_action_log;
```
