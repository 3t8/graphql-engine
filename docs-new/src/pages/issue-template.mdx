# Issue Template

As we merged https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/pull/3902 recently we plan to gradually migrate frontend code to TypeScript.

Console codebase is pretty large, so we would love your help! ðŸ’ª

### How to contribute?

1. Convert file from `.rst` to `.mdx`. 
     We used an auto transform tool (pandoc.org) to automate this and added the resultant content in  .txt file.
    a. Convert this `.txt` to `.mdx`.
    b. Use [this guide](guide.me)
    c. Validate content and cleanup misc divs and any invalid mdx data. 
2. Verify content correctness and preview in UI. 
3. Submit a PR! ðŸŽ‰
