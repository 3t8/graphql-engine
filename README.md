# Hasura engineering documentation

This site contains Hasura's engineering documentation: how we work, how to
onboard, what we're working on, how our code is structured, and how it works. If
you are a user, you are likely looking for our [user-facing
documentation](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/index.html)
instead. If you want to contribute to the project, make sure you have also read
our [contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

For the graphql-engine server documentation, see the [server](server) subfolder.

This documentation is a work in progress.
