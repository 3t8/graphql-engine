    server/docs: add instructions to fix loss of float precision in PostgreSQL <= 11 (#5187)

    This adds a server flag, --pg-connection-options, that can be used to set a PostgreSQL connection parameter, extra_float_digits, that needs to be used to avoid loss of data on older versions of PostgreSQL, which have odd default behavior when returning float values. (fixes #5092)

    Lower stack chunk size in RTS to reduce thread STACK memory (closes #5190)

    This reduces memory consumption for new idle subscriptions significantly
    (see linked ticket).

    The hypothesis is: we fork a lot of threads per websocket, and some of
    these use slightly more than the initial 1K stack size, so the first
    overflow balloons to 32K, when significantly less is required.

    However: running with `+RTS -K1K -xc` did not seem to show evidence of
    any overflows! So it's a mystery why this improves things.

    GHC should probably also be doubling the stack buffer at each overflow
    or doing something even smarter; the knobs we have aren't so helpful.

    Regression benchmarks setup (#3310)

    * Benchmark GraphQL queries using wrk

    * fix console assets dir

    * Store wrk parameters as well

    * Add details about storing results in Readme

    * Remove files in bench-wrk while computing server shasum

    * Instead of just getting maximum throughput per query per version,
    create plots using wrk2 for a given set of requests per second.
    The maximum throughput is used to see what values of requests per second are feasible.

    * Add id for version dropdown

    * Allow specifiying env and args for GraphQL Engine

    1) Arguments defined after -- will be applied as arguments to Hasura GraphQL Engine
    2) Script will also pass the environmental variables to Hasura GraphQL Engine instances

    Hasura GraphQL engine can be run with the given environmental variables and arguments as follows

    $ export HASURA_GRAPHQL_...=....
    $ python3 hge_wrk_bench.py -- --hge_arg1 val1 --hge_arg2 val2 ...

    * Use matplotlib instead of plotly for figures

    * Show throughput graph also.

    It maybe useful in checking performance regression across versions

    * Support storing results in s3

    Use --upload-root-uri 's3://bucket/path' to upload results inside the
    given path.When specified, the results will be uploaded to the bucket,
    including latencies, latency histogram, and the test setup info.
    The s3 credentials should be provided as given in AWS boto3 documentation.

    * Allow specifying a name for the test scenario

    * Fix open latency uri bug

    * Update wrk docker image

    * Keep ylim a little higher than maximum so that the throughput plot is clearly visible

    * Show throughput plots for multiple queries at the same time

    * 1) Adjust size of dropdowns
    2) Make label for requests/sec invisible when plot type is throughput

    * 1) Adding boto3 to requirements.txt
    2) Removing CPU Key print line
    3) Adding info about the tests that will be run with wrk2

    * Docker builder fo wrk-websocket-server

    * Make it optional to setup remote graphql-engine

    * Listen on all interfaces and enable ping thread

    * Add bench_scripts to wrk-websocket-server docker

    * Use 127.0.0.1 instead of 'localhost' to address local hge

    For some reason it seems wrk was hanging trying to resolve 'localhost'.
    ping was able to fine from the same container, so I'm not sure what the
    deal was. Probably some local misconfiguration on my machine, but maybe
    this change will also help others.

    * Store latency samples in subdirectory, server_shasum just once at start, additional docs

    * Add a note on running the benchmarks in the simplest way

    * Add a new section on how to run benchmarks on a new linux hosted instance

    Tighten up handling of admin secret, more docs

    Store the admin secret only as a hash to prevent leaking the secret
    inadvertently, and to prevent timing attacks on the secret.

    NOTE: best practice for stored user passwords is a function with a
    tunable cost like bcrypt, but our threat model is quite different (even
    if we thought we could reasonably protect the secret from an attacker
    who could read arbitrary regions of memory), and bcrypt is far too slow
    (by design) to perform on each request. We'd have to rely on our
    (technically savvy) users to choose high entropy passwords in any case.

    server: fix an introspection query caching issue (fix #4547) (#4661)

    Introspection queries accept variables, but we need to make sure to
    also touch the variables that we ignore, so that an introspection
    query is marked not reusable if we are not able to build a correct
    query plan for it.

    A better solution here would be to deal with such unused variables
    correctly, so that more introspection queries become reusable.

    An even better solution would be to type-safely track *how* to reuse
    which variables, rather than to split the reusage marking from the
    planning.

    server: add support for webhook connection expiration (#4196)

    * add expiry time to webhook user info

    This also adds an optional message to webhook errors: if we fail to
    parse an expiry time, we will log a warning with the parse error.

    * refactored Auth

    This change had one main goal: put in common all expiry time
    extraction code between the JWT and WebHook parts of the
    code. Furthermore, this change also moves all WebHook specific code to
    its own module, similarly to what is done for JWT.

    * Remove dependency on string-conversions in favor of text-conversions

    string-conversions silently uses UTF8 instead of being explicit about
    it, and it uses lenientDecode when decoding ByteStrings when it’s
    usually better to reject invalid UTF8 input outright. text-conversions
    solves both those problems.
