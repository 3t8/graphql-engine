    server: pass http and websocket request to logging context (#5470)

    * pass request body to logging context in all cases

    * add message size logging on the websocket API

      this is required by graphql-engine-pro/#416

    * message size logging on websocket API

      As we need to log all messages recieved/sent by the websocket server,
      it makes sense to log them as part of the websocket server event logs.
      Previously message recieved were logged inside the onMessage handler,
      and messages sent were logged only for "data" messages (as a server event log)

    * fix review comments
