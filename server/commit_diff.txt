    Restore AuthSpec tests erroneously removed in 8904e063

    Said commit had a lot of whitespace, formatting, and trivial
    refactorings. We should be mindful that these have a real cost in terms
    of review time and potential for bugs to be introduced.

    a weeder pass in CI would have caught this.

    Tracing.hs: Add B3 headers for tracing (#5517)

    Use B3-Propagation for Tracing Headers

    The Tracing headers which we use now X-Hasura- are not
    standard,though they help us trace requests within our
    systems but this willbreak/not work when we tend to use
    the other Trace Recorders.Hence it's better to refactor
    the code to allow using at least B3 headers for now.

    server: Pass EKG Metrics Store as argument to runHGEServer (#5560)

    * Add ekg-core to build-executable .cabal

    * Move creation of EKG Store to Main.hs

    This helps to share metrics between pro and OSS and
    helps surface the metrics from OSS in Datadog via
    Pro.
