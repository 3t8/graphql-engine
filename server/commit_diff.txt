    server: pass http and websocket request to logging context (#5470)

    * pass request body to logging context in all cases

    * add message size logging on the websocket API

      this is required by graphql-engine-pro/#416

    * message size logging on websocket API

      As we need to log all messages recieved/sent by the websocket server,
      it makes sense to log them as part of the websocket server event logs.
      Previously message recieved were logged inside the onMessage handler,
      and messages sent were logged only for "data" messages (as a server event log)

    * fix review comments

(Done, but we should re-visit this, if we do query plan caching)

    server: fix an introspection query caching issue (fix #4547) (#4661)

    Introspection queries accept variables, but we need to make sure to
    also touch the variables that we ignore, so that an introspection
    query is marked not reusable if we are not able to build a correct
    query plan for it.

    A better solution here would be to deal with such unused variables
    correctly, so that more introspection queries become reusable.

    An even better solution would be to type-safely track *how* to reuse
    which variables, rather than to split the reusage marking from the
    planning.
